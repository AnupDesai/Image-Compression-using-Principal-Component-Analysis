# Image-Compression-using-Principal-Component-Analysis

PCA approach to encode : 
  The PCA technique comes from Machine learning, where it is used for a process called dimensionality reduction. The idea is the same as lossy compression: if we can     find a way that represents the data well enough, we can save on space

Here are some screenshots of my work on PCA Image Compression:
